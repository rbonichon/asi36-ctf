# About

  These are Capture-The-Flags (CTF) binaries for ENSTA ASI 36.

  These programs have been statically compiled for x86 32 bits, unstripped but
  of course without debugging information. 

  You should be able to execute them on your machine, provided it uses a Linux OS.
  It might also work under Cygwin or Mac OS X but has not been tested on these platforms.

  In any case, it is convenient but not necessary to be able to run the executables.

  The goal of the challenges is to find a secret code that will emit the "Success!" message.  

  The secret uses only ASCII character codes that are available on a regular keyboard.
